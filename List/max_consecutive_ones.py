"""
Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most one 0.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0]
Output: 4
Explanation:
- If we flip the first zero, nums becomes [1,1,1,1,0] and we have 4 consecutive ones.
- If we flip the second zero, nums becomes [1,0,1,1,1] and we have 3 consecutive ones.
The max number of consecutive ones is 4.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 4
Explanation:
- If we flip the first zero, nums becomes [1,1,1,1,0,1] and we have 4 consecutive ones.
- If we flip the second zero, nums becomes [1,0,1,1,1,1] and we have 4 consecutive ones.
The max number of consecutive ones is 4.
